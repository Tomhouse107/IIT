## Tomas House's Profile

Here you will learn about my life, my personality and my project ideas.

### About Me

#### Background Information
My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.

#### Education History
My education history is a bit of a jumbled mess as my path has chopped and changed multiple times. I started out in a Chemical Engineering degree at the University of Surrey in the UK. I was inclined to do this degree because it put all the subjects I enjoyed at school, chemistry, mathematics and physics, all in one area. Unfortunately, the course didn’t live up to my expectations and the content felt more like a chore than the study I anticipated. I left the university and came over to Brisbane in May 2018 and took on a business certificate. As much as I enjoyed the subject, I didn’t see myself studying it long term. That’s how I ended up in information technology. I have always had a fondness for IT but for one reason or another I had never considered it a viable pathway for me. So far, I’m loving the course, albeit, a lot of the content is above anything I’ve done before with computers so it’s rather daunting.
