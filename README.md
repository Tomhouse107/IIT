## Tomas House's Profile

Here you will learn about my life, my personality and my project ideas.
### About Me

#### Background Information
My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future. Another interesting fact would be that I spent a few days trying to write my own HTML for my own website and eventually got lost.

#### Education History
My education history is a bit of a jumbled mess as my path has chopped and changed multiple times. I started out in a Chemical Engineering degree at the University of Surrey in the UK. I was inclined to do this degree because it put all the subjects I enjoyed at school, chemistry, mathematics and physics, all in one area. Unfortunately, the course didn’t live up to my expectations and the content felt more like a chore than the study I anticipated. I left the university and came over to Brisbane in May 2018 and took on a business certificate. As much as I enjoyed the subject, I didn’t see myself studying it long term. That’s how I ended up in information technology. I have always had a fondness for IT but for one reason or another I had never considered it a viable pathway for me. So far, I’m loving the course, albeit, a lot of the content is above anything I’ve done before with computers so it’s rather daunting.

### IT
#### My Interest in IT
As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I’ve enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I’m pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool with how technology based our society is nowadays.
If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.

#### Why RMIT?
I chose RMIT for a few reasons. The main and most important being the wonderful flexibility that they offer. Due to my circumstances of education and residency RMIT was the perfect place to learn my way at my pace. As I left the UK with no more than a good ATAR, I have been rather restricted in getting work and with trying to study further. Most people, who are on Bridging Visa’s such as myself, can’t afford full-time tertiary education as you cannot gain government help from Australia or from back home. RMIT allows you to take online courses which cost significantly less, and you have the added bonus of being able to take anywhere between 4 and 12 subjects per year. Perfect for those who have jobs or children who want to do part-time. RMIT have a system where you can take the first few subjects before committing to a degree thus taking the risk out of the decision as you can have a taster into what it’s like. This also means that if you pass you don’t need any other education to be given a chance to learn. This is perfect for people like me, who try hard and care about education, but their situation has limited their options.

#### What I Want From The Course
I’m sure if I was to look in depth at the curriculum, I could see what is going to be taught in the course, however that takes the fun out of it. During the degree I hope to learn everything IT. I would say my preferences are to learn coding and programming languages as well as how IT can be used to make a more sustainable world. This is something I care quite a lot about and I hope someday I can be involved in something great that involves the two.

### Ideal Job

#### Job Description
This is a job that I would ideally go for if given the opportunity. It’s a junior Developer job. This job could be something that you could get as a graduate or after having a few years under your belt. It involves developing, testing and maintaining software solutions using a range of programming languages. These include C#, ASP.NET, CSS and JavaScript. The main duties include converting designs into products and analysing existing code for errors or defects. I like the idea of problem solving and developing something from the ground up. It seems like a rewarding process to see all the way through until a final product.

#### Experience For The Job
For experience, the job entails someone to be confident with C#, ASP.NET, Web Forms, Javascript and CSS. The candidate needs sound understanding of programming and database principles as well as soft skills such as communication and customer service experience. It also requires your typical professional standards and ethics.

As a person who is only just starting to learn code, this is obviously something that I need to develop before I could apply for the job. I have the soft skills required as I have experience through previous occupations. I have developed customer service skills, communication skills and have a professional manner. Regardless I have a long time to perfect these skills whilst I learn how to become a better programmer. I will learn how to code and use other IT programs through my degree as well as through other online courses and websites.

### Personality Tests

#### 16 Personalities Test
According to this test I am a mediator. This means I am idealistic yet flexible and open-minded. It also means that I am creative and I combine my creativity with my open-minded nature. The study says that I am hard-working and dedicated when challenges pop up that would deter most. On the flip side, the test mentions some of my negative characteristics such as being impractical. Sometimes being idealistic can set me up for disappointment and therefore my morale could deteriorate. I agree with aspects of the test results but not all of them (which is expected). For example I believe I am a hard worker, and I can also think too simply sometimes as we are not in an ideal world. However, I don’t believe that I don’t like to see the bigger picture. Contrary to that, I often only get through things by seeing the end goal.

Overall I would say that the test is fairly accurate and so I must take it into consideration for team work. I should look for personalities that harmonise with my own yet would add substance for a good team. As a person who is idealistic, I need someone who can be realistic to bring my ideas back down to Earth. Also as a rather dominant character I would need to be in a team without too many like minded people or the project could get dragged in to many directions.

#### Emtrain Test
This test describes me as a “Theorist” person who likes to work through problems logically. I learn in a disciplined way with rigid schedules. Often, I can learn through models or other visual representations. My secondary learning style is based on a pragmatist style. This is when someone needs to see how what their learning applies to the real world. These people are experimenters and like to try tests and learn from positive or negative results. According to this learning style I am likely to get “stuck in” and get bored with lengthy discussions.

Although I agree with the test, I would say the secondary learning type is more realistic to the way I learn over the theorist approach. These results can be applied to a team environment. Ideally in a team I would want like minded learners so that we don’t have to spread the learning time too thinly. Everyone learning from similar methods would allow every team member to be able to understand where anybody’s confusion may arise and therefore be able to solve the issue. Everyone would be able to relate to each other and hopefully this would make a more connected team.

#### Creativity Test
The following test describes me as a complex and abstract mind. This means I can produce abnormal concepts from ideas or information. The complex side of the test means that I can handle large quantities if information at once and be able to manipulate and manage the information well. It says that I lack connection though. This means unless something has an original apparent connection, I may struggle to link the two concepts.

I’m not sure how much I agree with this test. I would say that I am able to hand and manipulate information, but I’m not convinced that I can’t see new connections between ideas. I would say that this is one of my strengths. The inaccuracy of the test could be purely down to the limited number of questions as creativity is such a complicated characteristic. I probably wouldn’t use this test to identify good potential fits for team members whom I can work with. I would need to take a few more creativity tests to see what type of creativity I should be looking for in a team.
