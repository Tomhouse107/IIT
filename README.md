## Tomas House's Profile

Here you will learn about my life, my personality and my project ideas.
## About Me

#### Background Information
My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future. Another interesting fact would be that I spent a few days trying to write my own HTML for my own website and eventually got lost.

#### Education History
My education history is a bit of a jumbled mess as my path has chopped and changed multiple times. I started out in a Chemical Engineering degree at the University of Surrey in the UK. I was inclined to do this degree because it put all the subjects I enjoyed at school, chemistry, mathematics and physics, all in one area. Unfortunately, the course didn’t live up to my expectations and the content felt more like a chore than the study I anticipated. I left the university and came over to Brisbane in May 2018 and took on a business certificate. As much as I enjoyed the subject, I didn’t see myself studying it long term. That’s how I ended up in information technology. I have always had a fondness for IT but for one reason or another I had never considered it a viable pathway for me. So far, I’m loving the course, albeit, a lot of the content is above anything I’ve done before with computers so it’s rather daunting.

## IT
#### My Interest in IT
As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I’ve enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I’m pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool with how technology based our society is nowadays.
If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.

#### Why RMIT?
I chose RMIT for a few reasons. The main and most important being the wonderful flexibility that they offer. Due to my circumstances of education and residency RMIT was the perfect place to learn my way at my pace. As I left the UK with no more than a good ATAR, I have been rather restricted in getting work and with trying to study further. Most people, who are on Bridging Visa’s such as myself, can’t afford full-time tertiary education as you cannot gain government help from Australia or from back home. RMIT allows you to take online courses which cost significantly less, and you have the added bonus of being able to take anywhere between 4 and 12 subjects per year. Perfect for those who have jobs or children who want to do part-time. RMIT have a system where you can take the first few subjects before committing to a degree thus taking the risk out of the decision as you can have a taster into what it’s like. This also means that if you pass you don’t need any other education to be given a chance to learn. This is perfect for people like me, who try hard and care about education, but their situation has limited their options.

#### What I Want From The Course
I’m sure if I was to look in depth at the curriculum, I could see what is going to be taught in the course, however that takes the fun out of it. During the degree I hope to learn everything IT. I would say my preferences are to learn coding and programming languages as well as how IT can be used to make a more sustainable world. This is something I care quite a lot about and I hope someday I can be involved in something great that involves the two.

## Ideal Job

#### Job Description
This is a job that I would ideally go for if given the opportunity. It’s a junior Developer job. This job could be something that you could get as a graduate or after having a few years under your belt. It involves developing, testing and maintaining software solutions using a range of programming languages. These include C#, ASP.NET, CSS and JavaScript. The main duties include converting designs into products and analysing existing code for errors or defects. I like the idea of problem solving and developing something from the ground up. It seems like a rewarding process to see all the way through until a final product.

#### Experience For The Job
For experience, the job entails someone to be confident with C#, ASP.NET, Web Forms, Javascript and CSS. The candidate needs sound understanding of programming and database principles as well as soft skills such as communication and customer service experience. It also requires your typical professional standards and ethics.

As a person who is only just starting to learn code, this is obviously something that I need to develop before I could apply for the job. I have the soft skills required as I have experience through previous occupations. I have developed customer service skills, communication skills and have a professional manner. Regardless I have a long time to perfect these skills whilst I learn how to become a better programmer. I will learn how to code and use other IT programs through my degree as well as through other online courses and websites.

## Personality Tests

#### 16 Personalities Test
According to this test I am a mediator. This means I am idealistic yet flexible and open-minded. It also means that I am creative and I combine my creativity with my open-minded nature. The study says that I am hard-working and dedicated when challenges pop up that would deter most. On the flip side, the test mentions some of my negative characteristics such as being impractical. Sometimes being idealistic can set me up for disappointment and therefore my morale could deteriorate. I agree with aspects of the test results but not all of them (which is expected). For example I believe I am a hard worker, and I can also think too simply sometimes as we are not in an ideal world. However, I don’t believe that I don’t like to see the bigger picture. Contrary to that, I often only get through things by seeing the end goal.

Overall I would say that the test is fairly accurate and so I must take it into consideration for team work. I should look for personalities that harmonise with my own yet would add substance for a good team. As a person who is idealistic, I need someone who can be realistic to bring my ideas back down to Earth. Also as a rather dominant character I would need to be in a team without too many like minded people or the project could get dragged in to many directions.

#### Emtrain Test
This test describes me as a “Theorist” person who likes to work through problems logically. I learn in a disciplined way with rigid schedules. Often, I can learn through models or other visual representations. My secondary learning style is based on a pragmatist style. This is when someone needs to see how what their learning applies to the real world. These people are experimenters and like to try tests and learn from positive or negative results. According to this learning style I am likely to get “stuck in” and get bored with lengthy discussions.

Although I agree with the test, I would say the secondary learning type is more realistic to the way I learn over the theorist approach. These results can be applied to a team environment. Ideally in a team I would want like minded learners so that we don’t have to spread the learning time too thinly. Everyone learning from similar methods would allow every team member to be able to understand where anybody’s confusion may arise and therefore be able to solve the issue. Everyone would be able to relate to each other and hopefully this would make a more connected team.

#### Creativity Test
The following test describes me as a complex and abstract mind. This means I can produce abnormal concepts from ideas or information. The complex side of the test means that I can handle large quantities if information at once and be able to manipulate and manage the information well. It says that I lack connection though. This means unless something has an original apparent connection, I may struggle to link the two concepts.

I’m not sure how much I agree with this test. I would say that I am able to hand and manipulate information, but I’m not convinced that I can’t see new connections between ideas. I would say that this is one of my strengths. The inaccuracy of the test could be purely down to the limited number of questions as creativity is such a complicated characteristic. I probably wouldn’t use this test to identify good potential fits for team members whom I can work with. I would need to take a few more creativity tests to see what type of creativity I should be looking for in a team.

## My Project

#### Overview
My project shall be to create an app that’s purpose is to reduce people texting and driving on the road. The aim is to increase safety in a society where technology is becoming a distraction. The app will consist of a text-to-speech service where the recipient of a message or notification has their text read aloud so that they can remain focused on driving. The driver will receive a notification and have the option to ignore or ‘answer the text’. If they choose to answer, our technology will read aloud the text with options for the driver to reply or not.

#### Motivation
In todays age we have technology everywhere. It is a simple and easy distraction that can often cause more harm than good if not respected. One place this is apparent is when people choose to text and drive. I have caught myself looking down to see my messages when hearing my phone beep while driving. This is dangerous and we need a solution. ‘Over 64% of road accidents in the United States have mobiles involved in one way or another’. This is 1.6 million people per year in the US alone.

#### Description
Technology is used to make life easier and solve problems. We can use technology to build a safer environment where we eliminate human factors and risk. Frankly, too many car accidents are caused each year by people who are irresponsibly distracted. We understand that driving can be boring and tedious and you can almost look for any distraction to change it up a little bit, but looking at your phone to check Facebook or to message your friends is not the way to do it. It is tempting to use your phone while driving and so the easiest thing to do is to remove the temptation. This is what our app is designed to do. It will keep eyes on the road and the attention where it is most necessary. The way the app works, is that once it is installed, it shall be linked up to your favourite messaging services. Then once you receive a message, you will be notified via audio, but your screen will not light up with a notification. Now a choice will be made to ‘answer the text’ if you are driving leisurely or if you’re in a tricky situation, you can ‘decline the text’ so that you can focus on the road.

Answering the text, effectively transfers the text into a call. Audio shall be presented stating who the message is from, and what they’ve said. After the audio clip is finished you can choose to reply to the sender via the ‘reply’ command. If you don’t feel like you need to respond you can just carry on driving as though nothing has happened. You can also link your music streaming applications and then play specific songs or playlists via speech. Once again, you are not tempted to look down at your phone.

Another feature the app will implement is customisability. This allows the driver to select what services that the phone will present while driving, if you have a lot of distracting messages coming from a group chat, you can just mute that chat for the duration of your drive. You can also choose certain ‘whitelisted’ people who you can receive messages from and if you get a message from someone else, the phone will not transfer text to audio. With the app holders permission, the app will allow you to showcase your details, letting others know if you are or aren’t taking messages right now as you are driving.

The app will have a ‘start’ option and then will only stop once you have come to a stop and press the ‘stop’ button.

#### Tools
The software needed is a text-to-speech programme. We could build off or use a similar model to Amazon’s ‘Alexa’ or Apples ‘Siri’. We would need to integrate a software that allows us to link our services to Facebook, iMessage, Spotify etc… . We will need app interface designers to make a seamless and simple design that people will enjoy to use. A marketing team is needed to push the product once its made so that people know the benefits of using the app and the dangers that texting and driving presents.

#### Skills Required
We will need programmers who can develop apps and developers who can create our own text-to-speech programme. If we work off other software that is already out in the market then it is more about user interface design and connectivity. We can use the mobiles built-in location tracker to monitor whether someone is driving and whether the app should be in use. We need a team who can make small changes to software but link it in a way that hasn’t been done before.

#### Outcome
The desired outcome is for the app to be successful and therefore create a safer driving environment. Hopefully if the app became mainstream then we could see a noticeable decrease in texting related car accidents. The technology could be used and applied to different things to reduce distraction. Such as putting your phone in a mode people can see when you are busy so they know not to disturb you. This could be used for when someone is studying, or at the hospital or even in a meeting.
