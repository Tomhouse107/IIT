### About Me

#### Background Information
My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.

#### Education History
My education history is a bit of a jumbled mess as my path has chopped and changed multiple times. I started out in a Chemical Engineering degree at the University of Surrey in the UK. I was inclined to do this degree because it put all the subjects I enjoyed at school, chemistry, mathematics and physics, all in one area. Unfortunately, the course didn’t live up to my expectations and the content felt more like a chore than the study I anticipated. I left the university and came over to Brisbane in May 2018 and took on a business certificate. As much as I enjoyed the subject, I didn’t see myself studying it long term. That’s how I ended up in information technology. I have always had a fondness for IT but for one reason or another I had never considered it a viable pathway for me. So far, I’m loving the course, albeit, a lot of the content is above anything I’ve done before with computers so it’s rather daunting.

### IT
#### My Interest in IT
As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I’ve enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I’m pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool with how technology based our society is nowadays.
If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.

#### Why RMIT?
I chose RMIT for a few reasons. The main and most important being the wonderful flexibility that they offer. Due to my circumstances of education and residency RMIT was the perfect place to learn my way at my pace. As I left the UK with no more than a good ATAR, I have been rather restricted in getting work and with trying to study further. Most people, who are on Bridging Visa’s such as myself, can’t afford full-time tertiary education as you cannot gain government help from Australia or from back home. RMIT allows you to take online courses which cost significantly less, and you have the added bonus of being able to take anywhere between 4 and 12 subjects per year. Perfect for those who have jobs or children who want to do part-time. RMIT have a system where you can take the first few subjects before committing to a degree thus taking the risk out of the decision as you can have a taster into what it’s like. This also means that if you pass you don’t need any other education to be given a chance to learn. This is perfect for people like me, who try hard and care about education, but their situation has limited their options.

#### What I Want From The Course
I’m sure if I was to look in depth at the curriculum, I could see what is going to be taught in the course, however that takes the fun out of it. During the degree I hope to learn everything IT. I would say my preferences are to learn coding and programming languages as well as how IT can be used to make a more sustainable world. This is something I care quite a lot about and I hope someday I can be involved in something great that involves the two.

#### Job Description
This is a job that I would ideally go for if given the opportunity. It’s a junior Developer job. This job could be something that you could get as a graduate or after having a few years under your belt. It involves developing, testing and maintaining software solutions using a range of programming languages. These include C#, ASP.NET, CSS and JavaScript. The main duties include converting designs into products and analysing existing code for errors or defects. I like the idea of problem solving and developing something from the ground up. It seems like a rewarding process to see all the way through until a final product.
